# Class Progression

For the time being, every class has a fixed progression through each level, and choices normally offered to the player, as well as any equipment they may use are hard-coded as shown in these tables. This is all very much subject to change.

> **Note:** This also means that equipment-related limitations may not be enforced. For example, the fighter will get plate armor, regardless of whether they actually have 15 strength. Similarly, the Wizard's spell book is also limited to whatever quantity the menus can currently handle, rather than Intelligence + Wizard Level.
